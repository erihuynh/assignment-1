    <h1><small>understanding me</small></h1>
</header>

<body>
    <p>my favorite part of being alive is my room.</p>
    <p class="hide">i can be anything else during the day, painting on masks that i can hardly even recognize to please people.</p>
    <p class="hide">yet, between the four walls right beside the staircase– i am me.</p>

    <p class="hide">i am me in the sense that i am comfortable purely existing.</p>
    <p>my existence feels small in the presence of others.</p>
    <p class="hide">it’s the size of a pea when i’m with my parents.</p>
    <p class="hide">it’s the size of an orange when i’m with my peers.</p>
    <p class="hide">it’s the size of the ocean when i’m in my room.</p>

    <p class="hide">i am me in the sense that it is a reflection of my mind.</p>
    <p class="hide">on days where i struggle to get up in the morning,</p>
    <p>my floor is littered with randomly scattered papers and books.</p>
    <p class="hide">on brighter days, my drawers are neatly organized and my duvet is nicely tucked into my bed.</p>

    <p class="hide">i am me in the sense that i am free.</p>
    <p class="hide">my accelerating heart rate suddenly slows and i am transported to another dimension.</p>
    <p>a pressure is lifted and i am weightless.</p>

    <p class="hide">i don’t know who i am.</p>
    <p class="hide">i feel lost in crowds of people, my hands clam up, and i feel weak.</p>
    <p class="hide">i am vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="hide">i am weak.</p>
    <p class="hide">when my feet reach the fluffy rug of my room, i know who i am.</p>
    <p class="hide">i am a girl trying her best.</p>
    <p class="hide">i am a girl trying to navigate life.</p>
    <p class="hide">i am a girl who loves her room–</p>
    <p>because the feeling of being understood transcends everything.</p>
